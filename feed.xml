        <title>Opti-Acoustic Perception (OASIS)</title>
        <description>
          Real-time opti-acoustic sensing for intervention systems in unstructured environments - 
          OASIS is an opti-acoustic fusion method that integrates data from optical images with voxel carving techniques to achieve real-time 3D reconstruction unstructured underwater workspaces. High resolution underwater 3D scene reconstruction is crucial for various applications, including construction, infrastructure maintenance, monitoring, exploration, and scientific investigation. Prior work has leveraged the complementary...

        <title>Shared Autonomy Framework (SHARC)</title>
        <description>
          Enabling remote novice users to conduct deep-ocean science operations with robotic manipulators - 
          Conventional underwater intervention operations using robotic vehicles require expert teleoperators and limit interaction with remote scientists. In this work, we introduce the shared autonomy for remote collaboration (SHARC) framework which enables novice operators to cooperatively conduct underwater sampling and manipulation tasks. With SHARC, operators can plan and complete manipulation tasks...

          Field work! Glider field ops - 
          Field work was one of the aspects to my grad program that I was the most excited about, and here we are! I’d participated remotely on a cruise my work was being tested on last year, but it’s not quite the same as being there in person. This trip was...

        <description>
          Sailing around Camden, backpacking in Baxter, and a brief visit to Acadia - 
          This was my first backpacking trip, my first time visiting Maine, and my first overnight trip on Mashnee! It was a fantastic break from the day-to-day work. I took a bus from Boston up to Camden, where Mashnee was moored. Over the next couple of days we sailed around Penobscot...

        <description>
          Introductory cruise aboard the R/V Armstrong - 
          First-year students in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program typically go on a 10-day cruise aboard the Cramer (the sister ship to the Seamans!) to get to know their cohort while getting some hands-on experience with common oceanographic sampling equipment. Unfortunately, COVID was still causing logistics issues when I enrolled in the...
