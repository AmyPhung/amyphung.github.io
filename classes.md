## Olin Ground Robotic Autonomous Vehicle Lab Research
Of the many different research teams in Olin's Robotics Lab, I decided to join this team since it had the most systems-level work - there was a significant mechanical, electrical, and software component, unlike the other teams which were often primarily software-focused.
#### Projects:
- [Autonomous Tractor Platform](https://amyphung.github.io/gravl/)

## Summer 2018 GE Internship
I applied to this internship to learn about what career opportunities were available in a mechanical engineering environment and ended up learning a lot about what work is like in the industry. My assignment was on a Product Support Team for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric_T700" target="blank">CT7/T700</a>  helicopter engines where I helped develop digital tools for the team.
#### Projects:
- [Rotorcraft Operations Center](https://amyphung.github.io/roc/ "Rotorcraft Operations Center")
- [Graphing GUI](https://amyphung.github.io/graphing-gui/ "Graphing GUI")

## Software Design (Spring 2018)
This class covered foundational python topics while providing flexibility in the projects we wanted to create.
#### Projects:
- Webcam-Based Fruit Ninja Game: Python-based, uses OpenCV to track hands for intuitive and immersive controls.
- ROS Robot Navigation: Created a ROS package to navigate a TurtleBot through a map

## Quantitative Engineering Analysis I (Spring 2018)
This class is an 8-credit experimental project-based class combining Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Physics together in one class.
See highlights video of this class <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFL4gd2IMm8" target="blank">here</a>
#### Projects:
- Boat: Designed and fabricated a boat to meet certain design requirements
- Facial Recognition: Applied linear algebra concepts to write facial recognition software in MatLab.
- Robots: Applied multivariable calculus concepts to do path planning, gradient ascent, and obstacle avoidance with NEATO robots

## Products and Markets (Spring 2018)
This class covered basics on various entrepreneurial topics through a series of group projects where the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)" target="blank">scrum</a> was encouraged.
#### Projects:
- Quiet Room on Campus: Seeing that there was a lack of quiet places to do things like make personal phone calls or comfortably have sensitive conversations on campus, we decided to set up a series of "quiet rooms" around campus to learn more about what type of space students wanted
- Laundry Latch: After experiencing and witnessing numerous accounts of smelly laundry machines on campus, we researched the problem more and concluded that the root cause of the smells was leaving the washing machine doors shut for prolonged periods of time. We developed the laundry latch, which would prevent people from closing the doors out of habit after emptying the machine  
- Interactive Care Packages: On the market today, there are plenty of subscription boxes and care packages, but most products focused on the idea of care packages as one-way gifts. Based on our experiences living away from home, we thought it'd be more meaningful to receive games and activities which both the sender and recipient can enjoy together, allowing them to create memories together despite the distance.

## Introduction to Instrumentation, Sensors, and Measurement (Fall 2017)
In this class, I learned about the basics of creating circuits and using various analog sensors. It was also my first introduction to using MatLab to generate different types of plots appropriate for the different types of data I collected with the circuits I built.
#### Projects:
- Built circuits to collect data from various sensors including strain gauges, humidity sensors, photodiodes, potentiometers, and thermistors
- EKG circuit to measure heart activity
-	Ballistocardiograph: Used bathroom scale to measure heart rate
-	Analog distance sensor display using ultrasonic sensors, op-amp comparator circuits, and LEDs

## Modeling and Simulation in Python (Fall 2017)
This class covered different types of models and how to implement them in Python to generate useful insights from a given dataset.
#### Projects:

## Design Nature (Fall 2017)
This class is intended as an introduction to mechanical engineering, where using SolidWorks to design and fabricate projects is first introduced. This class also had a significant emphasis on observing nature as a source of inspiration for design.
#### Projects:
- Alarm Clock Hopper:
- Goblin Shark 4th Grade Play Experience:
