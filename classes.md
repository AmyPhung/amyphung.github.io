## Olin Ground Robotic Autonomous Vehicle Lab Research (Fall 2017-Fall 2020)
Of the many different research teams in Olin's Robotics Lab, I decided to join this team since it had the most systems-level work - there was a significant mechanical, electrical, and software component, unlike most teams which were often primarily software-focused.
#### Projects:
- [Autonomous Tractor Platform](/gravl)

## Mechanical Prototyping (Spring 2019)
In this class, I worked on four projects that were much more hardware focused than most of my other software-related projects. Through these projects, I'd hoped to improve my ability to rapidly prototype mechanical systems since a foundational knowledge in this space would be useful for quickly putting together robust robots. Overall, I'd say things went fairly well, and my experiences putting together these projects helped to make my future projects a lot more sturdy.
#### Projects:
- [Wall-E](/wall-e "Wall-E Project Page"): Lasercut box that looks like Wall-E
- [Dolphin Automata](/dolphin-automata "Dolphin Automata Project Page"): Hand-crank powered automata with a pair of jumping dolphins
- [DaVinci Sculpture](/davinci-sculpture "DaVinci Sculpture Project Page"): Kinetic sculpture inspired by DaVinci's flying machine
- ["Welcome to Hell" Sculpture](/hell-sculpture "Hell Sculpture Project Page"): Kinetic sculpture retelling the tragedy of Orpheus and Eurydice

## Quantitative Engineering Analysis (Spring 2018 & Fall 2018)
This class is a two-part 16-credit experimental project-based class combining Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Physics together in one class.
See highlights video of this class <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFL4gd2IMm8" target="blank">here</a>
#### Projects:
- [Boat Design](/boat-design "Boat Design Project Page"): Designed and fabricated a boat to meet certain design requirements
- [Facial Recognition](/eigenfaces "EigenFaces Project Page"): Applied linear algebra concepts to write facial recognition software in MatLab.
- [Robotic Software](/neatos "NEATOs Project Page"): Applied multivariable calculus concepts to do path planning, gradient ascent, and obstacle avoidance with NEATO robots
- [Segway Robot](/segway "Segway Project Page"): Design and implementation of low-level controls to drive a balancing 2-wheeled robot along a parametric curve
- [EigenTricks](/eigentricks "EigenTricks Project Page"): Applying frequency analysis to identify different poi tricks

## GE Internship (Summer 2018)
I applied to this internship to learn about what career opportunities were available in a mechanical engineering environment and ended up learning a lot about what work is like in the industry. My assignment was on a Product Support Team for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric_T700" target="blank">CT7/T700</a>  helicopter engines where I helped develop digital tools for the team.
#### Projects:
- [Rotorcraft Operations Center](/roc "ROC Project Page")
- [Graphing GUI](/graphing-gui "Graphing GUI Project Page")

## Software Design (Spring 2018)
This class covered foundational python topics while providing flexibility in the projects we wanted to create.
#### Projects:
- [Webcam-Based Fruit Ninja Game](https://github.com/AmyPhung/InteractiveProgramming "GitHub Repo"): Python-based, uses OpenCV to track hands for intuitive and immersive controls.
- [ROS Robot Navigation](/ROS-map-navigation "Project Page"): Created a ROS package to navigate a TurtleBot through a map

## Products and Markets (Spring 2018)
This class covered basics on various entrepreneurial topics through a series of group projects where the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)" target="blank">scrum</a> was encouraged.
#### Projects:
- Quiet Room on Campus: Seeing that there was a lack of quiet places to do things like make personal phone calls or comfortably have sensitive conversations on campus, we decided to set up a series of "quiet rooms" around campus to learn more about what type of space students wanted
- Laundry Latch: After experiencing and witnessing numerous accounts of smelly laundry machines on campus, we researched the problem more and concluded that the root cause of the smells was leaving the washing machine doors shut for prolonged periods of time. We developed the laundry latch, which would prevent people from closing the doors out of habit after emptying the machine
- Interactive Care Packages: On the market today, there are plenty of subscription boxes and care packages, but most products focused on the idea of care packages as one-way gifts. Based on our experiences living away from home, we thought it'd be more meaningful to receive games and activities which both the sender and recipient can enjoy together, allowing them to create memories together despite the distance.

## Introduction to Instrumentation, Sensors, and Measurement (Fall 2017)
In this class, I learned about the basics of creating circuits and using various analog sensors. It was also my first introduction to using MatLab to generate different types of plots appropriate for the different types of data I collected with the circuits I built.
#### Projects:
- Built circuits to collect data from various sensors including strain gauges, humidity sensors, photodiodes, potentiometers, and thermistors
- EKG circuit to measure heart activity
-	Ballistocardiograph: Used bathroom scale to measure heart rate
-	Analog distance sensor display using ultrasonic sensors, op-amp comparator circuits, and LEDs

## Modeling and Simulation in Python (Fall 2017)
This class covered different types of models and how to implement them in Python to generate useful insights from a given dataset.
#### Projects:
- [Whale Populations Model](https://github.com/AmyPhung/ModSim-Project-1 "GitHub Repo")
- [Iced Coffee Model](https://github.com/AmyPhung/ModSim-Project-2 "GitHub Repo")
- [Freefall NERF Dart Model](https://github.com/AmyPhung/ModSim-Project-3/blob/master/project3-version1.ipynb "GitHub Repo")

## Design Nature (Fall 2017)
This class is intended as an introduction to mechanical engineering, where using SolidWorks to design and fabricate projects is first introduced. This class also had a significant emphasis on observing nature as a source of inspiration for design.
#### Projects:
- [Alarm Clock Hopper](https://photos.app.goo.gl/2359KCAwWvyvQ1ek8 "Photos"): A wind-up purely mechanical lasercut hopper that jumped after a set delay
- [Goblin Shark 4th Grade Play Experience](https://photos.app.goo.gl/HtSfhH8zGiA5NmhPA "Photos"): A game created for 4th graders with remote-controlled fish and two "goblin sharks." The goblin sharks, mounted to the sides of the play area, would attempt to catch the fish as they swam by
