When starting out with grad school, I was super excited for all the travelling I'd be doing between personal travel, attending conferences and doing field work. This would have been true had it not been for COVID - after SEA Semester I'd planned to travel around New Zealand, Austrailia, and visit Hawaii on the way back to LA, after getting my first paper accepted at IEEE Oceans I would've visited San Diego, my first talk at the Ocean Sciences Meeting would've been in Hawaii, and my first fieldwork opportunity would've been this past winter in Puerto Rico. Although those didn't pan out, I'm excited to share with you all a post about my visit to Atlanta for the Astrobiology Science Conference to kick off my grad school blog! 

I wrote the first part of this post on my flight back from Atlanta back in May, but admittedly didn't get to finishing this until the end of the year - welp, better late than never...

#### Traveling to Atlanta
Most of my flying is done between Boston and LA to visit family, and for these flights I typically take a red-eye at odd hours since those flights tend to be the cheapest. Since a flight to Atlanta is a lot shorter than one to LA, my flight ended up being at a much more reasonable hour. I was surprised to see the airport so busy - the line for TSA extended past the start of the queue!

<!-- TODO: Insert photo of boston airport - you know they're busy when they tell you to leave your shoes on and leave laptops inside bags. Maybe I should travel when it's busy more -->

For some reason, whatever was in the air that morning caused my nose and eyes to hate me (great timing, allergies). I didn't have time to get to the store before the flight, and ended up buying a much-needed and very-overpriced Claritin from the airport. Before you call me out on being unprepared, I've only needed a Claritin like once in my life before this, so this is not something that happens often. 

<!-- TODO: obligatory airport photos -->

The flight was pretty relaxed, I took a good nap and before I knew it we were landing.

<!-- TODO: is the mrta a subway or train -->
Once getting to Atlanta, I took the subway to the hotel where the conference would take place. I'd heard from folks that Atlanta's public transit was like LA's (read: not great), so I had my reservations - but I was honestly surprised by how clean and fast it was, at least between the airport and downtown. The subway car itself was much faster and cleaner than the ones in Boston, which was a pleasant surprise. The areas around downtown Atlanta looked like they'd have a lot of foot traffic since there were a lot of places to eat and shop, but I was surprised that there was hardly any, even though it was mid-afternoon. When getting off the train, I met two folks from CU Boulder that were also attending the conference and ended up tagging along for lunch after we dropped off our bags at the hotel.

The hotel itself was quite nice - I lucked out and got a room on the 22nd floor, and the view was just spectacular. When I was booking the room they'd run out of rooms with just one king bed, so I ended up in a room with two queen beds which was a bit excessive but that's what was available.

#### AbSciCon!
Before AbSciCon, I'd only ever attended conferences virtually, so this was my first time visitng a conference in person. I was a bit nervous since I wasn't sure what to expect, but it ended up being a fantastic week of networking and learning a lot about astrobiology. Honestly, I found it difficult to connect with people during the virtual conferences I'd attended previously since it was hard to make "small talk" with people over zoom, but after attending AbSciCon I can see now why people like to go to conferences to exchange ideas. 

Going to a conference alone is pretty intimidating. I should have spent more time paying attention in bio and chemistry, it's been a long time but I think it would have made a lot more talks understandable. I ended up asking a lot of people throughout the conference at poster sessions to explain "the obvious" to me (i.e. life needs phosphorus, basic chemistry stuff, cycles are important to sustain life, redox reactions, europa, enceladus, and titan all have an icy shell with liquid beneath the surface but titan has liquid methane)

Seeing people take notes made me realize I should have brought a notebook (note to self: bring a notebook next time) - I picked one up at the hotel

Schedule management? Apparently there's an app for that


Day 2
Spicy NASA town hall - someone really didn't like the plenary changes

Made shrinky-dink thing (yay coloring, it's been forever) - nasa mentoring thing

Throughout the conference I'd make remakrs on how the hotel was prelly pretty, but could also be pretty dystopian if the lighting was different. Apparantly also where spiderman was filmed

For dinner walked through other hotel - skybridge. Though it was closed and we had to walk around on the street anyways. Take-out Dinner with fancy table. Talked a lot about boats

Day 3
ML talk in the morning - finally a session that I understood most of

Lunch with folks from university of florida at peachtree center

Talk in the afternoon where convener went way over time, and didn't have a great presentation - I thought this was odd

Dinner with more folks from CU Boulder
