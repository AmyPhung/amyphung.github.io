subtitle: A segway robot that drives along a parametric curve

This class project was part of a segway robots module centered on learning about controls. The base deliverable was to get the robot to stand, drive forward, and spin, but we took this a step further and got the robot to also drive along a parametric curve.

Project Partner: Everardo Gonzalez

Other deliverables for this project included a paper documenting the control system we used, code for the robot, and a demo. See these links for more information about our project!

Tools used:
- **MATLAB** - used for determining wheel velocity commands based on parametric curve
- **Mathematica** - used for calculating and tuning the constants needed to complete our controls system
- **Arduino** - how we implemented our controller and loaded it onto the robot
