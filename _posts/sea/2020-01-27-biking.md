SEA has an assortment of bikes we can borrow to explore the area with, and it's been a really awesome resource so far! Did need to fix a flat tire before heading out, but there were plenty of tools and replacement parts so it wasn't an issue. (Got to put that engineering degree to work!)

Woods Hole is a really nice area with lots of beaches, bike paths, and summer homes. I've taken the bikes out a handful of times, and while the scenery has been nice, it's also been fairly chilly (especially considering I'm from L.A.).

Stating the obvious for those who live where it snows, but ice on the road is a lot more slippery on a bike than I had imagined it to be. It's so hard to find lakes, rivers, or bodies of water around where I live (I live in a SoCal desert), so this was a pleasant change.

I also saw this nice rock along a trail...

Well, that's a summary of all the cool/pretty looking things from my bike rides so far. I have two more weeks here, let me know if you know of any other cool things to look at within biking distance to Woods Hole!
