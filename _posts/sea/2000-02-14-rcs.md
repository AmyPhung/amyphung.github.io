The day we've all been waiting for, today we board the Robert C. Seamans!

After boarding the ship, I moved my stuff to my bunk then walked around and looked at different areas of the ship. Gotta make the most of arriving early - it's going to get pretty crowded here soon.

For storage, we each get one cubby for stuff, one drawer for shoes, and everything that doesn't fit in those two places goes in the bunk. The cubby is only around a cubic foot and a half in size, so my backpack and duffel definitely didn't fit inside it. Guess where it is - it's next to me in my bunk. I don't have a really large frame though, so it works out alright.

After everything was put away, I walked around the ship and snapped some photos.

A handful of us who arrived a bit earlier got to stand on the head rigging and attach a cover to the jib. How's that for some day 1 activity?

We'll be around Auckland for the next few days to learn more about the ship and the city before getting underway, so stay tuned for that!
