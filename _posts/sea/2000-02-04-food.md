Originally, I was going to lump this in with my
[post about the shore component](/sea-shore)
but it ended up completely flooding it with food photos. So more on food here!

We're given gift cards to pay for groceries for the week, and have arranged it so that 2 people are responsible for making dinner each night. The food that we've made has been pretty awesome, and although it was one of my primary concerns when moving in, it's worked out well. During the first week of classes, I wrote a blog post about our initial experiences

if you'd like to take a look!

Some highlights:

Of course, nothing would be complete without an occasional prank...

This last week, we had quite a bit of extra money left on our food budget, so we decided to step up our game a notch.

We had a lot of other awesome dishes including roast chicken, stuffed bell peppers, spaghetti + meatballs, bean chili, among others, but I can't seem to find the photos for all of those. If I find them later I'll add them in.

On another note, I think that's enough about food, now I want a snack...
