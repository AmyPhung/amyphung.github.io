In my mechanical prototyping class, I worked on four projects that were much more hardware focused than most of my other software-related projects. Through these projects, I'd hoped to improve my ability to rapidly prototype mechanical systems since a foundational knowledge in this space would be useful for quickly putting together robust robots. Overall, I'd say things went fairly well, and my experiences putting together these projects helped to make my future projects a lot more sturdy.

# Project 1: Wall-E Lasercut Box
For this first project, our assignment was to create a lasercut box using several different types of wood joints to develop some familiarity with the strengths and weaknesses of each of them. I thought it'd be fun to make a Wall-E inspired box that would look like an "ordinary" box but unfold into something that looked a lot more like Wall-E. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out!

# Project 2: Dolphin Automata
In this project, our assignment was to construct an automata that used a hand crank as an input and created some sort of interesting mortion with it. Some ways to do this included gears, cams, and linkages. Personally, I was fairly intrigued by linkages, so I wanted to create an automata that used them in some way. I settled on an automata that features two dolphins jumping over waves, with the internal linkages visible on one side.

# Project 3: DaVinci Inspired Sculpture
This project was created along with my classmates Mads, Katie, and Jack. After the success with linkages in the automata, I wanted to try my hand at a slightly more complex linkage set, so I spent most of my time working on the wings and the gearbox to drive the subsystem. The 3D-printed bevel gears worked much better than I had anticipated which was a pleasant surprise.

# Project 4: "Welcome to Hell" Sculpture
This project was created along with my classmates Eric, Ever, and Ben. We wanted to tell a story with our sculpture that fit with the "myths and legends" theme, and so we chose to share the tale of Orpheus and Eurydice through our work.
