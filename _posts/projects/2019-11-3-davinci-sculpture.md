The third project of my mechanical prototyping class featured a Renaissance-themed sheet metal sculpture, which I helped create alongside my classmates Mads, Katie, and Jack. After the success with linkages in the automata, I wanted to try my hand at a slightly more complex linkage set, so I spent most of my time working on the wings and the gearbox to drive the subsystem. The 3D-printed bevel gears worked much better than I had anticipated which was a pleasant surprise.
