For our final project in our Discrete Math course, my project partners and I wanted to find ways to use what we had learned in discrete to solve common robotics problems. Earlier in the course, we had touched upon the theory behind popular algorithms like Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford for finding shortest paths in a deterministic (unchanging) graph, which we all found particularly interesting. With our prior experience working with robots, we knew that the state of the world couldn't always be known at all times, so we thought it'd be interesting to take a closer look at the shortest paths problem in a more realistic case - when the state of the world could change.

Although our only required deliverable for this project was a 15-minute presentation, we figured that getting more practice with technical writing never hurts, so we put together a detailed written report as a supplement to our work to document our studies. Our final presentation slides and report are included below:
