This project was created as part of the open-ended final project in my Robotics Systems Integration course, which had a particular focus on designing robotics systems with soft actuators. Working with hardware during COVID proved to be challenging, especially with each of us working from a separate location. We were particularly intrigued by the [SoFi project](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/sofi-soft-robotic-fish), and thought it would be an interesting project to attempt to re-create with the supplies we had.

Project Partners: Everardo Gonzalez, Nathan Faber
