In QEA, we programmed NEATOs (robot vacuums) to complete a series of tasks while also learning the math behind the code. This project was split into a series of three smaller projects, including:

+ "The Bridge of Death" - have the robot drive along a parametric curve (Project Partner: Khang Vu)
+ "Mount Doom" - have the robot reach the top of a "mountain" using gradient ascent (Project Partner: Mark Goldwater)
+ "The Gauntlet" - have the robot use a lidar to detect and avoid obstacles while searching for a round target with RANSAC (Project Partner: Sherrie Shen)

At the end of the project, we attempted the ultimate challenge - to complete all three in a row!
