My name is Amy Phung and I am a student at Olin College of Engineering.

I grew up in Santa Clarita, California (For those of you who don’t know where that is, it’s in the desert slightly north of LA). Although I had my heart set on engineering since 4th grade, I still tried just about everything from playing tennis, attending debate competitions, and tutoring summer school students, but the hobbies that really stuck with me were tinkering with robots and baking. I struggled with making new friends throughout school, but I think as a result of this I tend to be really good friends with the people I get to know.

Funnily enough, I think I’m the same way with projects. It’s strange to think of having some form of “relationship” with my projects, but hear me out - I like talking to a lot of different people and also like trying lots of different activities, but when I find that person or project that really shares my passion for something, hours fly by when I’m working with said person or project. Now looking back, I’ve gotten to know most of my close friends so far from sharing a passion for a project we worked on together


I’d like to share a bit more about who I am as a person, but that’s hard to put into words. How about a quote? I really like the quote:

“Allow your passion to become your purpose, and it will one day become your profession”

I don’t generally like quotes because they tend to be pretty idealistic, but I sure do hope this one is true. I think it also sums up my goal in life pretty well. In my own words, if I could make one wish, I’d hope that I’ll be able to continue trying new things and doing what I love while remaining close to the people I love.

So now you know a bit more about me beyond the resume. Want to know what I’ve been working on? Check out the project pages <https://amyphung.github.io/projects/>! That’s plenty more than I’ve ever written about myself (maybe except for college applications), but I’m much more interested in hearing all about you! If you want to chat (or grab lunch, if you’re in the area), scroll down to the bottom of the page and use the platform of your choice to contact me!
