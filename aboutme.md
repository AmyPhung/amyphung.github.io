I've dreamed of working on exploration robots ever since 4th grade, when I visited the NASA JPL Open House back in 2008 and learned about the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity. Ever since that day, I've sought out opportunities to work on robots - I found a start with LEGO Mindstorms robots in elementary school, and joined an FRC ([FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc)) team in high school. building FIRST Robotics Competition robots in high school. After high school, I studied Robotics Engineering at Olin College and spent most of my time outside of class doing autonomous vehicle research with a [robotic tractor](/gravl). When I'm not working on robots, I also enjoy sailing, hiking, and
[spinning fire](https://youtu.be/YeLakPYpc1I) on occasion.

Spending a [semester abroad at sea](/sea) gave me a lot of time to reflect on my experiences, and opened my eyes to the importance of ongoing research related to the marine sciences - understanding our oceans is crucial since it provides us with the air we breathe, a means of transportation between continents, a source of food, and key resources like rare minerals and oil, just to name a few. As a roboticist, I believe that my role in this is to contribute to the tools used to increase this understanding on a large scale - namely, ocean robotics. The more I learn about the oceans, the more I realize just how much out there remains to be explored. Through my research, I hope to find ways to leverage my robotics background to help tackle solve some of the most difficult navigation & perception problems on board deep-sea exploration vehicles.
